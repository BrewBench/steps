BrewBench Steps is an Arduino step processing front end.

The initial use for this came from Greg Kallfa at [Vision Quest Brewing](http://www.visionquestbrewing.com) who built an Arduino keg washer and needed to easily adjust the timing for the washing steps.

```sh
# build code
yarn
# start webserver
gulp
```

You can also import a step manifest, check out [washer.yaml](src/assets/data/washer.yaml)
